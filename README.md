# jsGridLayout
A grid layout element for HTML, imitating WPF grid layout container.

COMPATIBILITY

There are two implementations, one using custom HTML5 elements, which is minimally supported (only Chrome fully supports custom elements as of today, to the best of my knowledge) and needs webcomponents libraries for maximum compatibility (grid.js). 
Another implementation uses custom attributes which are supported in almost all mainstream web browsers (gridcomp.js).
Obviously you only need to use one of them, depending on your requirements.s

USAGE

Take a look at .html files for to see usage examples.
